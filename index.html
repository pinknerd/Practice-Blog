        <p id = p1>On Tuesday 14th December 2021, I joined an amazing workshop (Hosted by Midori Ko√ßak and Daniela Savalli) with a female tech community 
            from over 10 countries around the world. "How cool is that?". We started the session by introducing ourselves, where we are from and why we are interested in improving
            our HTML and CSS skills. It is refreshing to see so many women in tech who are passionate about coding and
            web development.

        <p id = p2>We got to learn about the basics of HTML and CSS and discovered lots of tips and tricks such as embedding Google Fonts
            into our webpage, how to use JS Fiddle, how to embed an image into HTML from an external website and there is even a website called
            <a href= "https://placekitten.com" style="color: white">placekitten.com</a> which creates a rotation of cute cat photos for you to use in your website!

        <p id = p3>At the end of the session, we got the chance to set up a Github Repository to create a practice blog and setup a GitHub pages site with
            our own unique <q>.io</q> name.
